COPERNICUS/S2,"Sentinel-2 MSI: MultiSpectral Instrument, Level-1C","Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral
imaging mission supporting Copernicus Land Monitoring studies,
including the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover,
as well as observation of inland waterways and coastal areas.The Sentinel-2 data contain 13 UINT16 spectral bands representing
TOA reflectance scaled by 10000. See the Sentinel-2 User Handbook
for details. In addition, three QA bands are present where one
(QA60) is a bitmask band with cloud mask information. For more
details, see the full explanation of how cloud masks are computed.Each Sentinel-2 product (zip archive) may contain multiple
granules. Each granule becomes a separate Earth Engine asset.
EE asset ids for Sentinel-2 assets have the following format:
COPERNICUS/S2/20151128T002653_20151128T102149_T56MNN. Here the
first numeric part represents the sensing date and time, the
second numeric part represents the product generation date and
time, and the final 6-character string is a unique granule identifier
indicating its UTM grid reference (see MGRS).The Level-2 data produced by ESA can be found in the collection
COPERNICUS/S2_SR.Clouds can be mostly removed by using
COPERNICUS/S2_CLOUD_PROBABILITY.
See
this tutorial
explaining how to apply the cloud mask.For more details on Sentinel-2 radiometric resolution, see this page.Provider: European Union/ESA/CopernicusRevisit Interval

MODIS/006/MOD13A1,MOD13A1.006 Terra Vegetation Indices 16-Day Global 500m,"The MOD13A1 V6 product provides a Vegetation Index (VI)
value at a per pixel basis. There are two primary vegetation layers.
The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution
Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer
is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background
variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions.
The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination
caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI
and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional
surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy
aerosols, and cloud shadows.Documentation:User&#39;s GuideAlgorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)General DocumentationProvider: NASA LP DAAC at the USGS EROS CenterResolution500 meters

NOAA/DMSP-OLS/NIGHTTIME_LIGHTS,"DMSP OLS: Nighttime Lights Time Series Version 4, Defense Meteorological Program Operational Linescan System","The Defense Meteorological Program (DMSP) Operational Line-Scan System
(OLS) has a unique capability to detect visible and near-infrared (VNIR)
emission sources at night.Version 4 of the DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights Time Series consists of
cloud-free composites made using all the available archived DMSP-OLS smooth
resolution data for calendar years. In cases where two satellites were
collecting data, two composites were produced.Provider: Earth Observation Group, Payne Institute for Public Policy, Colorado School of MinesResolution927.67 meters
BandsNameDescriptionavg_visThe average of the visible band digital number values with no further filtering.stable_lightsThe cleaned up avg_vis contains the lights from cities,
towns, and other sites with persistent lighting, including gas flares.
Ephemeral events, such as fires, have been discarded. The background noise
was identified and replaced with values of zero.cf_cvgCloud-free coverages tally the total number of observations
that went into each 30-arc second grid cell. This band can be used to
identify areas with low numbers of observations where the quality is
reduced.avg_lights_x_pctThe average visible band digital number (DN) of cloud-free
light detections multiplied by the percent frequency of light detection.
The inclusion of the percent frequency of detection term normalizes the
resulting digital values for variations in the persistence of lighting.
For instance, the value for a light only detected half the time is
discounted by 50%. Note that this product contains detections from fires
and a variable amount of background noise.Image and data processing by NOAA&#39;s National Geophysical Data Center.

NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V06,GPM: Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) v6,"Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) is an international
satellite mission to provide next-generation observations of
rain and snow worldwide every three hours. The Integrated Multi-satellitE
Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified algorithm that provides
rainfall estimates combining data from all passive-microwave
instruments in the GPM Constellation.This algorithm is intended to intercalibrate, merge, and interpolate
all satellite microwave precipitation estimates, together with
microwave-calibrated infrared (IR) satellite estimates, precipitation
gauge analyses, and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine
time and space scales for the TRMM and GPM eras over the entire globe.
The system is run several times for each observation time, first
giving a quick estimate and successively providing better estimates
as more data arrive. The final step uses monthly gauge data to
create research-level products. See IMERG Technical Documentation
for more details on the algorithm.Documentation:
